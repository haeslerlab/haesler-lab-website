My project aims to develop a new technological platform to measure neural signals. There are two main issues with current devices: they have a low spatial resolution and do not conform to brain tissue. 

Integrating active components, such as transistors, could improve the electrode density and therefore the spatial resolution of the recordings. Using flexible substrates and thin-film technology would result in flexible arrays that can bend to the brain's curvature and prevent damages to the tissue.
