My research focus at NERF revolves around the clinical strategies for fluidic interaction with the brain. In situations where drug therapies lack the specificity necessary to combat central nervous system pathologies, innovative solutions are needed to increase the penetration and efficacy of neuroactive agents.

One of these conditions is Glioblastoma Multiforme, a malignant form of brain cancer that is characterised by its extremely aggressive nature and, consequently, very slim chances of survival. In this context, my research aims to improve the delivery of agents to certain target regions within the brain as well as provide the tools for better in vivo tumour characterisation.
