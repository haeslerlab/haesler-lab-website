I am interested in how the brain extracts properties from sensory stimuli and represents them in a modality-independent fashion. My research project at NERF focusses on how stimulus novelty from olfactory and auditory stimuli is represented and where this converges to give rise to similar explorative behaviour. 

We will use whole-brain functional ultrasound imaging to identify brain regions and networks implicated in novelty detection. By comparing both the olfactory and auditory modality we hope to learn where the sensory-specific novelty signals originate and where they converge.
