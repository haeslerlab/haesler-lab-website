Jordi Cools deals with coordination and hands-on support on various projects related to novel in vitro and in vivo devices for neuro-applications. Examples include flexible, intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) arrays using large-area electronics, novel catheter designs for convection-enhanced drug delivery (CED) for the treatment of brain cancer, and novel microelectrode platforms for neural recording and stimulation.
