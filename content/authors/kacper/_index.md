I am a postdoc in Sebastian Haesler's lab, where we study how animals process novel vs. familiar odors. I am particularly interested in the fact that novelty is highly rewarding and activates the same dopamine neurons which respond to food, drugs and other pleasant stimuli. My project is focused on understanding the mechanisms which control these dopamine responses.
