My project aims to unravel the mechanisms underlying plasticity, and habituation in the olfactory system during novel odor detection. To address this objective, different regions and neuromodulatory systems are studied. During this project, DREADDs, viral circuit tracing and electrophysiology are used to investigate these mechanisms.
