      <description>&lt;p&gt;When humans or animals detect novel stimuli in their environment, they respond with distinct orienting and exploratory behaviours, caused by an innate drive of perceptual curiosity. We study the brain mechanisms in the olfactory system that gives rise to these behaviours, and how these behaviours are affected by differences in stimulus quality and neuromodulatory input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we develop new experimental methods to improve our abilities to measure and manipulate neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the imec campus, NERF is the perfect centre to mix cutting-edge technology with neuroscience. At Haesler lab, we specifically focus on improving our understanding of the brain by developing new tools that allow us to better interact with the central nervous system. This line of research is proceeding along different routes that explore different aspects of brain connectivity, ranging from purely electrical, through to electrochemical and all the way to fluidic.&lt;/p&gt;
